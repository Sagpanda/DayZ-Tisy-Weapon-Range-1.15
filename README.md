# DayZ-WeaponRange
*NOTE*- This .json file will possibly only work on Next-Gen consoles due to the amount of items spawned in and the processing power required for them.
---
Place "WeaponRange.json" into your custom folder.
add "custom/WeaponRange.json" too the objectSpawnersArr line in cfggameplay.json file.
In your cfgplayerspawnpoints.xml file, add the co-ordinates <pos x="1313.32" z="14484.58" /> so that you spawn at the Range.
Thankyou and have fun :)
