DayZ-WeaponRange - Made by sagpanda

NOTE- This .json file will possibly only work on Next-Gen consoles due to the amount of items spawned in and the processing power 
required for them. (I haven't checked but from my experience of last gen I dont know if it could handle this)

In the top right, press code and download the ZIP file. 
Place "WeaponRange.json" into your custom folder. 
Add "custom/WeaponRange.json" too the objectSpawnersArr line in cfggameplay.json file. 
In your cfgplayerspawnpoints.xml file, add the co-ordinates x="1313.32" z="14484.58" so that you spawn at the Range. 
It is also advised that you remove all zombie and wolf spawns and aslo Dynamic Toxic zones from your server. 

Thankyou and have fun :)
